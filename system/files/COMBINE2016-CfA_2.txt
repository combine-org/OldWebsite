COMBINE 2016: 7th Computational Modeling in Biology Network Workshop

19-23 September 2016, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

http://co.mbine.org/events/COMBINE_2016


The "Computational Modeling in Biology" Network (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate 
the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and 
related fields. COMBINE 2016 will be a workshop-style event with oral presentations, 
posters, and breakout sessions. The five meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE 
standards and associated or related standardization efforts, as well as presentations 
of tools using these standards. Oral presentations will be selected from the submitted 
abstracts. In addition, poster sessions will allow people to inform each other about their 
software and other projects in a setting that fosters interaction and in-depth discussion.
