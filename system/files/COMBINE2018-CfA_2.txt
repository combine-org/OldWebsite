COMBINE 2018: 9th Computational Modeling in Biology Network Workshop

8-12 October 2018, Boston, MA, USA

https://co.mbine.org/events/COMBINE_2018


The "Computational Modeling in Biology" Network (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology and related fields. COMBINE 2018 will be a workshop-style event with oral presentations, posters, and breakout sessions. The five meeting days will include talks about the COMBINE standards and associated or related standardization efforts, as well as presentations of tools using these standards. Oral presentations will be selected from the submitted abstracts. In addition, poster sessions will allow people to inform each other about their software and other projects in a setting that fosters interaction and in-depth discussion.
